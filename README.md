**Welcome to the Universal Space Initiative (USI)!**

As a new software engineer at USI, it's important to demonstrate your coding skills before we can entrust you with the responsibilities that come with the lives of our astronauts.

**Your first task is straightforward:** You are to create a program that records some key information about our astronauts. Here's what you need to do:

- **Create a variable to store the astronaut's name.** Use a `String` data type for this variable.
- **Create a variable to store the astronaut's age.** Use an `int` data type for this variable.
- **Create a variable to store the astronaut's rank.** Again, use a `String` data type for this variable.
- **Create a variable to store the duration the astronaut has been in space.** Use a `double` data type for this variable, representing the time in days.

Next, you will input some test data into these variables:

- **Name:** Buzz Aldrin
- **Age:** 90
- **Rank:** Colonel
- **Time in Space:** 12.0784 days

Finally, using the variables you've created and the test data provided, your program should output the following message:

\`\`\`
Buzz Aldrin is 90 years old.
He is a Colonel and has spent 12.0784 days in space.
\`\`\`

Ensure that your program outputs this message exactly as shown, using the values stored in your variables.
